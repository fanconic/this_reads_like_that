# This Reads Like That
This is the code of the experiments for the submission.

## Introduction
Deep neural networks, designed to provide human-interpretable decisions through their architecture, have recently become an increasingly popular alternative to the post-hoc interpretation of traditional black-box models. Perhaps the most widely used approach among these networks is the so-called prototype learning, in which similarities to learned latent prototypes serve as the basis for classifying an unseen data point. Previously, prototypical networks were mostly used in the computer vision domain with common encoder models. In this work, we research their structure to the problem of natural language processing, and more precisely to classification. We introduce a learned weighted similarity metric to extend previous work. Therefore, we compute similarity on a basis of the most informative dimensions of the sentence embedding, which outperforms traditional similarity measures in all our experiments. Additionally, we propose a way to retrieve the most similar words from the prototype and the test sample as an interpretability enhancement mechanism, which does not rely on an a priori choice of the number of words.

## Setup
### Installation
Clone this repository.
```bash
$ git clone 
$ cd this_reads_like_that
```

I suggest to create a virtual environment and install the required packages.
```bash
$ conda create --name nlp_env pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 --channel pytorch
$ conda activate nlp_env
$ conda install --file requirements.txt
```

### Repository Structure
- `train.py`: Main training loop
- `rationales_training.py`: Trains the model on the human-annotated rationale dataset and computes the faithfullness
- `config.yaml`: Config yaml file, which has all the experimental settings.
- `run.sh`: Runs the training script, including the conda environment. The config.yaml file is copied to `experiment_configs`
- `gpu_experiments.sh`: Runs the training script on a SLURM cluster, using GPUs. The output file is saved in `experiment_outputs`

## How to train
On your local computer:
```
bash run.sh <your_experiment_name>
```

On a SLURM cluster:
```
bash gpu_experiments.sh <your_experiment_name>
```
