hilarious , ultra - low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) .
they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self - fulfillment .
the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get - out , but you could spend ten times the film 's budget ( a reported $ 27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue
half as good as this .
originally rated nc-17 for language . not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears .
